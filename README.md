Hi, I'm Manuel De La Mora.

I'm a web developer from Lambda School who's looking to create all kinds of content for everyone that's not only easy to use but are also fun and exciting! I used to be a graphic designer so I have a critical eye for layout and design for what is not only aesthetically appealing but easy to process. With those skills paired with what I learned at Lambda, I know I can create web applications that's exciting to look at and works fluidly with the user in mind.
