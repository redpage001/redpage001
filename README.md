Hi, I'm Manuel De La Mora.

I'm a web developer from Lambda School who's looking to create all kinds of content for everyone that's not only easy to use but are also fun and exciting! I have a critical eye for layout and design and want nothing more to make work that's exciting to look at and works fluidly with the user in mind.
